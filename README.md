# MatFileViewer

This is a simple GUI viewer to view the binary MATLAB files (.mat) without MATLAB.

Every time I want to view a .mat file, I have to launch MATLAB, which is time-consuming.

So I write MatFileViewer to view the mat file.

**This software supports reading 1D and 2D mat files, but does not support 3D data.**

## How to use it

1. Users can use MatFileViewer by running python script or exe (only for windows x64)
2. In the GUI, select the .mat file and view the data.
